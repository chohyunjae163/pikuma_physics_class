# Motion of Physical Bodies
## Three Laws of Motion
1. Inertia: if no force is applied on an object, its velocity shall not change.
2. Force,Mass,Acceleration: the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. f=ma a=f/m
3. "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."


## Why Calculus
 physics software simulation works by making several small predictions\
based on the laws of physics.
 perform these predictions using a mathematical technique called integration.\
 the smaller the deltat time, the better will be out prediction.

### Differentiation
if we have a function graph of pos vs. time, we can get the velocity\
by differentiating the position at a certain time t.\
v = dp/dt. the derivative of position is velocity.

if we have a function graph of velocity vs. time, we can get\
the acceleration by differentiating the velocity at a certain time t.\
a= dv/dt. the derivative of velocity is acceleration

### Integration
acceleration is constant. how do we get velocity?
integrate the acceleration to find the velocity
v= a*dt = v0+at
integrate the velocity to find the position
p= v*dt = p=p0+v0t+at^2/2
euler integration
